# Weather-Forecasting
The classification problem of rain prediction is discussed.
For the rain prediction, Delhi weather data that is available on kaggle is used.
The data visualization, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, data preprocessing is done.
Twenty machine learning algorithms are used to solve this problem.
These machine learning algorithms include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Bagging Decision Tree,
Boosted Decision Tree, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost),
Random Forest, Voting Classification, Neural Network, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Guassian Mixture Model (GMM), Ridge Classifier,
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Mutilayer Perceptron (MLP), Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
and Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
